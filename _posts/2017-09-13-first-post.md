I have decided to try traditional, old school blogging as a way to keep working my writing muscles. The inspiration for the "notes" moniker came from a newly launched feature of the [Niskanen Center's website](https://niskanencenter.org), the [Niskanen Notes](https://niskanencenter.org/notes/). In the [first post](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/notes/welcome-niskanen-notes/) they state:

> In the Golden Age of yore, there was a wonderful something called a “blog.” Writers of all persuasions would jot chatty short items on their personal online diaries. Pithy and informal in tone, these “posts” were nevertheless frequently full of insight and erudition. For a time, an ecosystem of blogs flourished, facilitating wide-ranging debate about politics, policy, and even  philosophy across ideological and partisan lines. Our children deserve to know.
> ...
> Still, the original, breezy blog form remains unrivaled as a vehicle for the quick hit, the hot take, and the public-service link dump. That’s why Niskanen Notes is bringing the wonk blog back. In this space you’ll find the Niskanen Center’s policy staff dishing up tantalizing short takes on news and views, as well as useful links to and comment on new and interesting policy-relevant research.

I hope to do the same sort of thing here. It will allow me to comment on news related to energy and environmental policy as well as draft portions of my [book](http://matthewcnowlin.com/book/), which is frankly not being written fast enough.
