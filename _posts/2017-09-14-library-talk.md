I recently had the honor to be invited to give a public talk on climate change at the [Charleston County library](http://www.ccpl.org/content.asp?id=14611&action=detail&catID=5374&parentID=5374) downtown. The talk covered the basics of climate science as well as some policy approaches.

<br />
Here are the slides from the talk: <a href="{{ site.url }}/files/gccPres2017.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file-powerpoint-o"></i>&nbsp;slides</a>
