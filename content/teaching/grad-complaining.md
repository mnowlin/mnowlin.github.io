This course is an intensive introduction to some main themes in social theory. It is required of first year Ph.D students in the sociology department. Each week we will focus on something grad students complain about when they are forced to take theory. You are required to attend under protest, write a paper thatâ€™s a total waste of your time, and complain constantly. Passive-aggressive silence will not be sufficient for credit.
