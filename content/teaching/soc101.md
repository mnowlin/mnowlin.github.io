This course is an introduction to sociology for majors and non-majors. We will explore how social networks, organizations, and institutions influence people's identities and beliefs, their opportunities in life, and their everyday choices. We will investigate how class, gender, race, and cultural differences are created and maintained in places like the college campus, hospitals, the workplace, and elsewhere. We will learn about an apply some of the tools sociologists use to study these processes. As we go, we will also consider ethical controversies surrounding these and related topics. This course fulfills SS, CCI, and EI general education requirements. It will also help prepare students for the behavioral science portion of the MCAT exam.
