Are we seeing a move in economic sociology from the idea of
"embeddedness" to that of "relational work"? If so, is this a good
idea? I argue that an economic sociology focused on relational work
has the potential to open fresh ways of thinking about central
questions in social theory in much the same way that Mark
Granovetter's seminal paper on embeddedness did more than twenty five
years. But there are more and less
interesting ways that this way of thinking might develop. The less
interesting route is, unfortunately, the easiest one to take. For
something more interesting to happen, we should avoid treating
"relational work" as---variously---a rhetorical banner, a catch-all
term, or a euphemism for a needlessly restricted sort of cultural
sociology of economic life. To fulfil its potential, advocates of
relational work should focus on strategic and conflictual elements
that are present in the perspective but typically overlooked.
