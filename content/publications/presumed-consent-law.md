Although everywhere managed through gift exchange, the legal 
  procurement of human organs in Western countries is institutionalized in
  different ways. In particular, law in some countries allows for the consent
  of the donor to be presumed (absent a recorded decision to "opt-out") while
  others require that prospective donors "opt-in." More broadly, donor
  procurement takes place within health systems which institutionalize
  different relationships between the individual, the medical profession and
  the state. Using time-series data from sixteen OECD countries, I
  investigate variation in procurement rates. Countries with presumed consent
  laws are found to have higher procurement rates. Evidence from case-studies
  strongly suggests that presumed-consent legislation may be a marker for other
  organizational practices. Welfare state regimes are found to have weaker but
  notable effects, suggesting a link between varieties of welfare capitalism
  and the growing world of organ and tissue harvesting.
