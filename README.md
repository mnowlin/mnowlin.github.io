# Matthew Nowlin's website

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

I have borrowed liberally from Jordi Pont-Tuset's [site](http://jponttuset.github.io), as well as [Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org).
