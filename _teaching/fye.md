_Course Description_: Energy is required to power the American economy and provide the lifestyles to which Americans have become accustomed. However, the production and use of energy, from all sources, entails risks to human health and the environment. In this course we will examine how risk related to the production of energy is understood by the public and policymakers. Specifically, this course will examine the risks and benefits associated with nuclear energy. We will center the course on the question of whether the use of nuclear energy should be decreased or expanded in the United States.
